# 1. Text editing

Text files can be viewed as plain text or with syntax highlighting for one of the supported languages. Font size is adjusted in the popup switching between modes and is remembered individually for different modes.

You can pick between a number of included fonts or import new OpenType or TrueType fonts as a pro feature.

Looking at source code you can tap anywhere to start editing. Done in the upper right corner stops editing. You undo latest changes with the undo-button above the keyboard on iPad or by shaking your iPhone. If you want to undo all your changes, switch to the Status tab where you can revert the file to how it was at last commit.

Any text selection can be transformed with action extensions, which will let you do things such as URL encode text from within the editor. Shortcuts is the prime example of such a application.

When your selection matches a valid CSS color you can adjust this. Placing the caret where a color is expected the popup menu also lets you use the color picker to make a new color.
Use .editorconfig files to control encoding, newline style and indentation in a manner supported by a wide range of editors and IDEs.
