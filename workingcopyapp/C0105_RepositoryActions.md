# 1.5 Repository actions

To make it easier to perform important actions a **floating** fingerprint button is available in the lower right corner on iPhone. This button opens a repository status sheet with easy access to `Commit`, `Revert`, `Fetch`, `Pull` & `Push` and lists modified files.

On iPads with sufficient screen space these repository actions are available at the top of the screen without the need to open any sheet. It gets easier to remember what each button does when you realize the icons are used on the status sheet and in context menus as well.

On iPad the fingerprint button can be dragged into a new window to show the repository status sheet and since this displays modified files and updates as files change, it can be very useful while using external editors such as **Textastic**.

You can tap and hold this floating button to change the location on screen.
