# Committing changes

When you have file modifications `the Changes tab` lights up. You can see what has been added in green and what has been deleted in red. If you are satisfied with the changes you can commit them to the repository with a button on the `the Status tab`. A faster way, however, is to swipe left on the file in the directory listing. Swiping left can generally be performed on lists of files, directoris and repositories allowing convenient access to frequent actions.

You can commit a single file, multiple files or the entire repository at once, and it is considered good practice to make a commit represent one conceptual change to your repository. Following this practice also makes it easier to come up with concise yet descriptive commit messages.

Word suggestions are shown above the keyboard when writing your commit message. Suggestions are based on the filenames and changes you are about to commit, as well as previous commit messages in the same repository. This is combined with frequently used sentences in commit messages. No information from your commits or repository is collected to make this happen.

The list of files include everything that can be committed. You tab files or unstage for commit and the rightmost button shows the differences for this particular file between working directory and last commit. When looking at differences you can stage/unstage individual hunks by long-tapping and swiping making it possible to commit some changes in a file but leave others uncommitted.

When you have made one or more commits your on-device repository is seen as being ahead of the remote repository and you `push` these commits to the remote. Because `Commit` and `Push` are distinct actions you can `Commit` while offline and `Push` once you get back online.

To `Push` after `Commit` tap and hold a repository and `Push` from the context menu. You need to ***unlock*** the ability to `Push` with an in-app purchase.
