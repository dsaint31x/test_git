# 2.1 Clone catalog

When cloning repositories from **BitBucket** and **GitHub** you can enter your credentials to get a list of repositories to clone. Working Copy tries to show the most relevant repositories at the top, these being the ones where you have administrative or push privileges. Your GitHub Gists and BitBucket Snippets are also available form this list.

If the list is long, enter keywords in the search field in order to only see repositories containing these. If you do not see the repository you wish to clone, you can still copy-paste the clone URL into the top-field manually.

Organizations on GitHub can be configured to **restrict** third-party applications such that repositories are not listed and you might need to **ask your administrator** to approve Working Copy.

You configure additional **hosting providers** form Working Copy settings or you can clone using a URL from the clipboard.
