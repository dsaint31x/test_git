# Accessing files

Data in **Working Copy** is organized as ***repositories***, containing directories, which themselves contain either sub-directories or files. Tapping a file shows the file content, the changes to the file and the status of the file.

File content is shown with syntax highlighting for source-code and a preview of html and document files. To edit you will need to switch away from **Preview mode** with the button at the top showing your current mode. Tap the action-button in the upper-right corner to send the file to other applications such as Mail through a share sheet.

The editing inside Working Copy is bare-bones and neutral in that neither programming languages, markdown, nor regular text files get special treatment. If you are performing heavy editing consider using a specialized text editor app for programming, markdown or other purposes.  You can read [more](https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/extending-ios) about using Working Copy in combinations with other applications.

To copy files tap and hold to show a context menu, pick `copy`, then navigate to the destination directory and press `+` in the upper right corner to insert `File from clipboard`. Move files and directories by ***dragging*** them around directory listing.
